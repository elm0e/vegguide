# vegguide
iOS version of the VegGuide application.  This is a companion to the vegguide.org web site, which also hosts the REST services used by the application.

This is the first iPhone/iPad application that I submitted to the App Store.  I tried to write it without using a lot of third party libraries just to see what I would run in to.

The application is available here:
